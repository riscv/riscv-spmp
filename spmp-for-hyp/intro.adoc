The RISC-V S-mode Physical Memory Protection (SPMP) for Hypervisor integrates the SPMP and Hypervisor extensions by providing a two-stage SPMP. The first stage, vSPMP, in control of VS-mode allowing a guest supervisor to specify memory protection policies within its guest physical address space, while the second stage, hSPMP, extends the baseline S-mode SPMP with support for the hypervisor to enforce physical memory access policies on guest memory accesses.
