== Interaction with other proposals

This section discusses how SPMP interacts with other proposals. 

*RISC-V PMP enhancements*: SPMP is compatible with ePMP proposal, and uses almost the same encoding as ePMP. 

*J-extension pointer masking proposal*: When both PM and SPMP are used, SPMP checking should be performed using the actual addresses generated by PM (pointer masking).
