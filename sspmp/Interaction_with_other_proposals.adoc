== Interaction with other proposal

// This section discusses how SPMP interacts with other proposals. 

// *J-extension pointer masking proposal*: When both PM and SPMP are used, SPMP checking shall be performed using the actual addresses generated by PM (pointer masking). 

// *Hypervisor extension*: SPMP support for virtualization is the subject of a future extension.

// *Smstateen extension*: SPMP adds readable and writable supervisor states, which can be abused as a covert channel if the OS/hypervisor is not aware of SPMP (thus the states won't be context-switched).
// The `Sspmp` occupies *bit 53* in the `mstateen0` register. and the `Sspmpsw` occupies *bit 52* in the `mstateen0` register of `Smstateen` extension.

*Smpmpmt extension*: Bits 5 and 6 in `spmpcfg` (see <<spmpcfg>>) are used for memory types if `Smpmpmt` is implemented; otherwise, they are reserved for future standard use.


*Zicfiss extension*: The encoding `spmpcfg.RWX==010 & spmpcfg.SHARED==1` (see <<spmpencode>>) is used for a shadow stack region if `Zicfiss` is implemented, else reserved for future standard use.
