== Interaction with other proposals

This section discusses how SPMP interacts with other proposals. 

// *RISC-V PMP enhancements*: SPMP is compatible with the ePMP proposal and uses almost the same encoding as ePMP. 

*J-extension pointer masking proposal*: When both PM and SPMP are used, SPMP checking should be performed using the actual addresses generated by PM (pointer masking). 

*Hypervisor extension*: Virtualization support for the SPMP extension will be an independent proposal.

*Smstateen extension*: SPMP adds readable and writable states in S-mode, which can be abused as a covert channel if the OS/hypervisor is not aware of SPMP (thus the states won't be context-switched).
It is desired that SPMP occupies a bit in the `mstateen` register of Smstateen extension, which can control supervisor access to SPMP states.
