== Interaction with other proposal

// This section discusses how SPMP interacts with other proposals. 

// *J-extension pointer masking proposal*: When both PM and SPMP are used, SPMP checking shall be performed using the actual addresses generated by PM (pointer masking). 

*Hypervisor extension*: SPMP support for virtualization is the subject of a future extension.

// *Smstateen extension*: SPMP adds readable and writable supervisor states, which can be abused as a covert channel if the OS/hypervisor is not aware of SPMP (thus the states won't be context-switched).
// The `Sspmp` occupies *bit 53* in the `mstateen0` register. and the `Sspmpsw` occupies *bit 52* in the `mstateen0` register of `Smstateen` extension.
