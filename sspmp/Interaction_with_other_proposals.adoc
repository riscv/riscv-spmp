== Interaction with other proposals

This section discusses how SPMP interacts with other proposals. 

*J-extension pointer masking proposal*: When both PM and SPMP are used, SPMP checking shall be performed using the actual addresses generated by PM (pointer masking). 

*Hypervisor extension*: SPMP support for virtualization is the subject of a future extension.

*Smstateen extension*: SPMP adds readable and writable supervisor states, which can be abused as a covert channel if the OS/hypervisor is not aware of SPMP (thus the states won't be context-switched).
Therefore the `Sspmp` occupies *bit 3* in the `sstateen0` register, and the `Sspmpsw` occupies *bit 4* in the `sstateen0` register of Ssstateen extension.
