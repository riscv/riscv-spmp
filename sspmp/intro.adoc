== Introduction

This document describes the RISC-V S-level Physical Memory Protection (SPMP) proposal to provide isolation when virtual memory (via an MMU) is unavailable or disabled.
RISC-V based processors recently stimulated great interest in the emerging markets of internet of things (IoT) and automotive devices.
However, use of virtual memory is usually undesirable for these markets in order to meet resource and latency constraints.
Without the use of an MMU, it is difficult on such devices to isolate the S-mode operating systems (e.g., RTOS) and user-mode applications from each other.
The SPMP extension features an architecture and programming model similar to the existing PMP approach, providing mechanisms for an S-mode OS to support secure processing and fault isolation of U-mode software by limiting the physical addresses accessible to U-mode software running on a hart.
