== Introduction

This document describes the RISC-V S-mode Physical Memory Protection (SPMP) proposal to provide isolation when virtual memory (via an MMU) is unavailable or disabled.
RISC-V based processors recently stimulated great interest in the emerging markets of internet of things (IoT) and automotive devices.
However, use of virtual memory is usually undesirable for these markets in order to meet resource and latency constraints.
Without the use of an MMU, it is difficult on such devices to isolate the S-mode operating systems (e.g., RTOS) and user-mode applications from each other.
The SPMP extension provides mechanisms for an S-mode OS to support secure processing and fault isolation of U-mode software via limiting the physical addresses accessible by U-mode software running on a hart.
