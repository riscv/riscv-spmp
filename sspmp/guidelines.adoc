== Recommended Programming Guidelines

When configuring SPMP to isolate user-mode tasks from each other and from the
operating system (OS) executing in supervisor mode, two primary usage models
arise, depending on whether the available SPMP entries can simultaneously
accommodate all required memory ranges for both the user tasks and the OS:

- *Static Configuration*: all SPMP entries are programmed during system
initialization. This model assumes that the number of available entries is
sufficient to cover the complete set of memory regions assigned to user tasks
and the OS without further modification. 

- *Dynamic Configuration*: SPMP entries are reprogrammed on each context switch.
This model is employed when the number of available SPMP entries is insufficient
to simultaneously represent all relevant memory regions, requiring dynamic
updates to enforce memory isolation between tasks.

=== Static Configuration

In the static configuration model, the number of available SPMP entries is
sufficient to accommodate all required memory ranges for user-mode tasks and
the OS. In this case, SPMP entries are programmed once during system
initialization and remain unchanged at runtime. Only the `spmpswitch`
register(s) need to be updated during context switches between user-mode tasks. 

The OS begins by allocating SPMP entries and populating the `spmpaddr[i]` and
`spmpcfg[i]` CSRs with the appropriate address ranges and permissions for each
user-mode task. If the OS itself is to be protected using SPMP, additional
entries must be allocated and configured with the OS memory ranges, with the `S`
bit (Supervisor bit) set in `spmpcfg[i]`. 

After initializing the entries, the OS must also set the corresponding bits in
the `spmpswitch` register to activate these entries, and enable the allowlist
policy for supervisor mode by setting the `SMAA` bit in the `ssecfg` CSR. 

Prior to launching the first user task, the OS sets the bits in `spmpswitch`
corresponding to the SPMP entries assigned to that task. During a context
switch, the OS clears the current task's entry bits and sets those of the newly
scheduled task using the `csrc` and `csrs` instructions, respectively. On RV32
systems, both `spmpswitch` and `spmpswitchh` must be managed as a continuous
pair.

=== Dynamic Reconfiguration

In this configuration model, the available SPMP entries are insufficient to
simultaneously represent the memory ranges required for all user-mode tasks and
the supervisor. As a result, the OS must dynamically reconfigure SPMP entries
for user tasks on every context switch. Notably, for any given hart, the number
of SPMP entries must still be sufficient to hold both the supervisor entries
and the entries for the currently executing user-mode task.

Where sufficient SPMP entries exist to cover all tasks and the OS, an
implementation may simply update `spmpswitch` on context switches. Otherwise,
the following sequence is recommended for dynamic reconfiguration:

1. *Disable Entries for the Outgoing Task*.
Use the `csrc` instruction to clear the `spmpswitch` bits corresponding to the
SPMP entries of the outgoing task. A bitmask representing active entries
(typically stored in the task's control block) should be passed as an argument. 

2. *Update SPMP Address Registers*.
Write the `spmpaddr[i]` CSRs with the address ranges corresponding to the
memory regions of the incoming task. 

3. *Update SPMP Configuration Registers*.
For each corresponding `spmpcfg[i]` field: 

- Clear the existing configuration bits using the `csrc` instruction with an
appropriate mask; 

- Set the desired configuration using the `csrs` instruction. 

4. *Enable Entries for the Incoming Task*.
Use the `csrs` instruction to write to `spmpswitch`, passing a bitmask that
enables the SPMP entries allocated to the incoming task.

[NOTE] 
==== 
It is recommended that SPMP entries configured to protect the
supervisor (i.e., entries with `spmpXcfg[i].S = 1`) remain resident and are not
reprogrammed during the context-switch process. Maintaining these entries as
persistent minimizes reconfiguration overhead and ensures consistent
enforcement of memory protection for the supervisor across task switches.

=== Entry Configuration Recomendations

When programming SPMP entries, a trade-off exists between using exclusively
Naturally Aligned Power-Of-Two (NAPOT) or Top-Of-Range (TOR) address-matching
modes.

While NAPOT allows compact encoding for power-of-two-aligned regions using a
single entry, it may lead to internal fragmentation if the region size exceeds
the actual requirement, resulting in memory waste. On the other hand, TOR mode
(particularly in its generic form) requires two SPMP entries per protected
region (base and top), which may exhaust available entries more quickly.
However, for regions that are naturally power-of-two aligned, TOR may still be
encoded with fewer entries.

This trade-off becomes especially relevant in MCU environments, where local
memories are often sparsely mapped to fixed address ranges associated with
specific core functions. In such cases, exclusive use of NAPOT or naïvely
pairing TOR entries may be inefficient or lead to undesirable gaps in
protection. Additionally, while it is possible to define multiple contiguous
regions with different access permissions using overlapping or consecutive TOR
entries, this technique can introduce subtle dependencies. Sharing a top address
between two address spaces (e.g., supervisor and user) can lead to unintended
interactions: reducing the supervisor region may inadvertently expand the
adjacent user region. Similarly, replacing a shared top address during context
switches could expose previously protected memory.

Given these risks, the following configuration model is recommended:

- Use TOR mode exclusively, treating each pair of `spmpaddr[i]` registers
(even/odd indexed) as a base/top pair defining a single memory region;

- Conceptually, view SPMP entries as organized into pairs: (0/1), (2/3), ...,
(62/63). Only the odd-indexed entries are enabled via the corresponding bits in
`spmpswitch`, as each odd entry finalizes the definition of a region;

- Allocate and populate SPMP entries in descending index order (i.e., from lower
priority to higher priority), starting from the highest index downward. This
allocation strategy allows the OS to define temporary subregions by configuring
unused lower-index entries without needing to reconfigure existing higher-index
(priority) ones.

This disciplined use of TOR-mode SPMP entries ensures clearer isolation
boundaries, reduces the likelihood of configuration errors, and improves runtime
flexibility for memory protection schemes.

=== Re-configuration Non-preemption and Synchronization

To preserve the integrity of SPMP state, the reconfiguration process during a
context switch must be executed as a non-preemptible critical section. This
requirement stems from the need to update multiple control and configuration
CSRs, and any interruption or concurrent modification during this process can
result in transient inconsistencies or unintended access permissions.

In the *dynamic reconfiguration model*, the critical section must be enforced
across updates to the following CSRs: `spmpaddr[i]`, `spmpcfg[i]` , and
`spmpswitch` . In the *static configuration model*, this concern is relevant
only for RV32 systems with more than 32 SPMP entries, where both `spmpswitch`
and `spmpswitchh` must be updated in coordination.

To prevent asynchronous supervisor-level interrupts during reconfiguration, the
supervisor must clear the `SIE` (Supervisor Interrupt Enable) bit in the
`sstatus` CSR. Furthermore, synchronisation mechanisms (e.g., mutexes or
spinlocks) must be employed to serialise access to SPMP CSRs in multi-threaded
or multi-core systems, ensuring that concurrent modifications do not result in
conflicting or corrupted configurations.

By enforcing non-preemption and proper synchronisation, software ensures that
SPMP protections remain deterministic, secure, and verifiable across context
switches.
